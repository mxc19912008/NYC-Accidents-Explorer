# Interactive NYC Accidents Shiny Application

### EDAV Final Project

## Introduction

The NYPD adds and updates new records each month for the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95). Each record in the data represents a collision in NYC by city, borough, precinct and cross street. 

The objective was to make this data interactively visiable to the audience so that the users are able to explore patterns with respect to accidents/injuries/death. 

For this final project, a Shiny application was developed that allows users to work with an interactive map and see accidents, injuries and death locations and relative number which match a users-specified selection of criteria. In developing the interactive application, the data was selected by specifying the latest 10,000 records in 2018 for quick rendering and use of the map. Details of proposed analysis and hypothesis along with summary metrics are provided in this final summary.
